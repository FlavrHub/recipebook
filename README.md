# About

This is a simple application for scraping and parsing food recipe data found on the web in [hRecipe](http://microformats.org/wiki/hrecipe) format, producing results in [json](http://json.org/).

This project was inspired by [this answer](http://opendata.stackexchange.com/a/4286) to a query for an open database of recipes.
